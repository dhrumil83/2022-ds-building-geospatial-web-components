# Web Components

![Web Components](img/webcomponentslogo.png)

---

# About Web Components

- Suite of different technologies (web standards)
- Allows you to create reusable custom elements
  - `<my-custom-element>`
  - Functionality encapsulated
  - Utilize them in your web apps
- Supported by modern browsers

---

# Technology

- Custom elements
  - Browser-compatible elements
  - Use native APIs
  - DOM element lifecycle
- HTML slotting
- `<slot>` elements
- Shadow DOM
  - Encapsulates component HTML & CSS
  - `<slot>` tag for distributing content

---

# Configuring Web Components

Properties & Attributes

```html
<my-component prop="myValue"></my-component>
```

Slots

```html
<my-component><button slot="footer" /></my-component>
```

---

# Named Slots

To customize certain regions

```html
<calcite-card>
  <h3 slot="title">Nicolas Cage</h3>
  <img slot="thumbnail" src="https://www.placecage.com/c/300/136" />
  <span slot="subtitle"
    >Nicolas Kim Coppola, known professionally as Nicolas Cage, is an American
    actor and filmmaker.</span
  >
</calcite-card>
```

<iframe width="310" height="310" data-src="snippets/card.html" data-preload scrolling="no"></iframe>

---

# Default Slots

For default content placement

```html
<calcite-split-button primary-text="My Button!">
  <calcite-dropdown-group>
    <calcite-dropdown-item>Option 1</calcite-dropdown-item>
    <calcite-dropdown-item>Option 2</calcite-dropdown-item>
    <calcite-dropdown-item>Option 3</calcite-dropdown-item>
  </calcite-dropdown-group>
</calcite-split-button>
```

<calcite-split-button primary-text="My Button!">
  <calcite-dropdown-group>
    <calcite-dropdown-item>Option 1</calcite-dropdown-item>
    <calcite-dropdown-item>Option 2</calcite-dropdown-item>
    <calcite-dropdown-item>Option 3</calcite-dropdown-item>
  </calcite-dropdown-group>
</calcite-split-button>

---

# Basic Web Component

```js
class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `<h1>Hello world</h1>`;
  }
}

customElements.define("my-component", MyComponent);
```

```html
<my-component></my-component>
```

# Component Architecture

---

# Stencil.js

[![Stencil.js](img/stencil-logo.png)](https://stenciljs.com/)

- Toolchain for building Design Systems
- Built by Ionic Framework team
- Compiles Web Components
- Virtual DOM, Typescript, and JSX
- [Getting Started](https://stenciljs.com/docs/getting-started)

---

# Basic Component Class

```jsx
import { Component, Prop, h } from "@stencil/core";

@Component({
  tag: "my-first-component",
})
export class MyComponent {
  // Name should be a public property on component
  @Prop() name: string;

  render() {
    return <p>My name is {this.name}</p>;
  }
}
```

---

# Basic Component HTML Markup

```html
<my-first-component name="Matt">
</my-first-component>
```

When rendered, the browser will display `My name is Matt`

# Patterns & Practices

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="img/2022/dev-summit/bg-7.png" data-background-size="cover" -->

# Application Architecture

---

# Map viewer Architecture

- Host application
  - It provides the application shell which is built using the calcite components based on the ArcGIS for JavaScript Widget framework

- Map Viewer is built as a micro frontend based application as a composition of features developed as web components by different teams.

- Some of the Geospatial web components/Micro-Frontends used in Map Viewer
  - Popup configurator
  - Effects
  - Sketch
  - Charts
  - Symbology


# Demo: Esri web apps using geospatial components

---

# Benefits of Micro frontend  Architecture

- Benefits of Micro frontend Architecture
  - Independence: In a traditional monolithic architecture, The application is tied to one single framework, whereas in Micro frontend approach the components like charts, popups can chose their own technology stack, are self-contained and independently upgradable.
  - Easier change management: Since we are building smaller component based micro apps which are independent from the application it simplifies change management.
  - Speed of Development: The autonomy in decision making allows the component teams to deliver the features much more faster than the traditional model.
  - Mission Focussed: Each feature being built as Micro Applications using web component means it is more focussed in its mission to develop, test and refactor than monolith.

# Geospatial components patterns & practices

- Micro frontend composition in the browser: Using Web Components provides us a client-side composition approach to compose these different features to map viewer.

  - Shared Design System: As multiple teams are building components to use in Map Viewer like large application , having a shared design system like calcite components becomes important to provide consistent look and feel across all frontend components.
  - "Props Down, Events Up" communication pattern is used from the MapViewer App to pass different required properties in each micro app based components.
  - It is recommended the Components get the application state via Props than having shared state with the Application Shell.
